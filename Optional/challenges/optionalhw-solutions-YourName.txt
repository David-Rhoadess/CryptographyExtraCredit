Challenge-01: Meet NataSHA (5 points)
------------------------------------------------
The recovered key:
3bf1ce3e4dfc
(0x3bf1ce3e4dfc)

The recovered plaintext blocks (both of them):
Meet_NataSHA_which_is_not_a_SHA_although
_we_use_it_not_to_hash_but_to_encrypt...

Steps of your solution:
I minicked the meet in the middle attack we used for challenge 3. First I modified the given decryption function to only take 3 key bytes and to decrypt input with only 3 rounds. Next, I modified the given encryption function to
only take 2 key bits and to only encrypt input through 2 rounds. Next, I used the given plaintext-ciphertext pair. I fed the ciphertext into my decryption function with every possible combination or 3 bytes and saved the output
in a dictionary to keep track of what keys generated what output. Next I fed the plaintext into my encryption funtion with every possible combination of 2 bytes, after each encryption I checked to see if the output was in the
array I previously generated. If it is, 



Put your attack script and all files that it uses in a folder named meet_natasha, zip the folder, and submit also meet_natasha.zip. We should be able to unzip the submitted file and run your script without any additional effort.

Challenge-02: Iterative Guessing (5 points)
-----------------------------------------------
The decrypted payload:
All computers are hackable. This has as much to do with the computer market as it does with the technologies. We prefer our software full of features and inexpensive, at the expense of security and reliability. That your computer can affect the security of Twitter is a market failure. The industry is filled with market failures that, until now, have been largely ignorable. As computers continue to permeate our homes, cars, businesses, these market failures will no longer be tolerable. Our only solution will be regulation, and that regulation will be foisted on us by a government desperate to "do something" in the face of disaster.

Your modern refrigerator is a computer that keeps things cold. Your oven, similarly, is a computer that makes things hot. An ATM is a computer with money inside. Your car is no longer a mechanical device with some computers inside; it's a computer with four wheels and an engine. Actually, it's a distributed system of over 100 computers with four wheels and an engine. And, of course, your phones became full-power general-purpose computers in 2007, when the iPhone was introduced.
